## Inspiration

Our inspiration to build this project for the Shellhacks Hackathon is being able to present our solution at a bigger platform. We feel that learning never stops and hackathons prove to be instrumental for us to maintain our learning curve. We have come up with Lyriceum with an intention to provide the user with a platform to save lyrics efficiently. So after brainstorming with the perspective of a user we feel our solution can implement a new successful user functionality.

## What it does

Admit it, we all have a secret place where we copy & paste our favorite lyrics. But wouldn't it be easier to just have it all in one place? We built Lyriceum to give the user functionality to save lyrics with just a click, or solution implements Spotify API to search and lyrics.ovh API to show the lyrics. It's a brilliantly simple way to save from a given set of lyrics, just by selecting it. After the successful implementation of saving the lyrics, we thought why not give users an immersive experience by displaying top charts around the world, one-click play on Spotify, quotes by Drake, etc.

## How we made it

Built using: TypeScript JavaScript HTML/CSS Spotify API lyrics.ovh API Angular

## Challenges we ran into

We have learned the hard way that trying to learn Angular in three days and having a full-fledged project ready within a weekend is a tall order! Implementing APIs also definitely had a learning curve, and we spent a good chunk of time on it. There were many challenges faced by us along the way like refreshing access token from the Spotify API, as it was expiring by default in an hour, we solved this using the Client Credentials Flow instead of the Authorization Credentials flow which we were using previously. Implementing the dynamic Dropdown was also a bit of a challenge for us. Towards the end of the project we ran into challenges connecting our site to a domain, but it was all well worth the effort to conclude.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

At times, we thought we wouldn't make it, or finish the project in time. We stuck with it till the very end, thinking we'll have a website that can be demoed, to say the least. We felt this was a prominent idea that needs to be out there, this functionality of saving the lyrics came after a lot of brainstorming but we feel the solution is well worth the effort. We are proud of not giving up as we thought when the going gets tough the tough get going. Certainly, using the APIs for the website as a beginner are a few of the accomplishments that we're proud of.

## What we learned

We have learned so much! TypeScript and JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and also how to host a website with a custom domain, have all been valuable learnings from the hackathon, we are thankful to Shellhacks for organizing workshops on Web Development, it proved to be a great resource, we now have a better understanding of services, components, and how data gets transferred. We also got to work with APIs and how to extract data from different places.
